            Local Storage Vs. Session Storage
          </h1>
          <p>
            <span >Local Storage :</span>Access to the Document's local storage object is provided by this read-only interface attribute; 
            the data is saved across browser sessions. Similar to sessionStorage, with the exception that localStorage data is erased
             when the page's session expires, or when the browser window is closed. When a browser's final "private" tab is closed, 
             it is cleared.
          </p>
          <p><span>Session Storage :</span>The read-only sessionStorage property provides access to Session Storage objects.
             Local storage data never expires, in contrast to session storage data that is deleted after a page session ends, 
             which is the difference between the two types of storage.

            Global Scope Vs. Block Scope

          <p>
            <span >Event Loop :</span>A variable is considered to be defined outside the global scope if it is declared outside of any functions or curly brackets (). Once a global variable has been declared, it can be used everywhere in your code, including in functions.
          </p>
          <p><span>Block Scope :</span>You can only access a variable that is declared with const or let inside of a curly brace () when you declared a variable inside any scope.
